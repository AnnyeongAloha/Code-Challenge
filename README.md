A repo of Code Challenges done during my time at Code Fellows.



This repo showcases the different scripts created during my time here in Code Fellows. 
We're learning these skills because it will give us a foundation to learning how to create our own scripts that allow us to automate a computing task.
I learned how to use grep, bash commands/scripts, and Powershell scripts.
My favorite code assignment would have to be [Code-Challge:04](https://github.com/AnnyeongAloha/Code-Challenge/blob/main/201d6-day04.sh) because this script taught me how to make directories with files in them. I would find this useful if I would like to make a new directory with a text file in it to start a new project of some sort.Shell scripting can be applied to the workplace when automating repetitve tasks such as backing up files and file management. As a System Admin; you use shell scripting to manage and configure servers,
What scripts would you continue to improve if you had the time?

I would want to continue improving every single script I've turned in to review it and get a better understanding of it but to also improve it and make it my own script. But if I had to choose 1, I'd choose day05 code challenge. I'd want to go back and understand that concept.
I hope to improve my understanding of reading scripts and understanding what the script does.
